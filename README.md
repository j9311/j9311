### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I'm an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner with a 400+ hour software development certification yearning for a challenging position in Cloud Architecture / Development. I am scheduled for my AWS Solutions Architect - Associate exam in mid December 2021. I value sincerity from/with coworkers and simplicity in solutions design. I'll always be working towards learning and helping others reach their true potential. ðŸ”­

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently looking to collaborate on a 5G Edge Computing Project using AWS, Raspberry Pi, and moisture sensors...ðŸŒ±
